  <p class="mainHeader">Privacy Policy</p>
  <p class="mainTopic">Overview</p>

  <p class="mainP">Your privacy is extremely important to us at Aurawin.  We recognize that how information is collected and used is a huge responsibility, and our affiliated sites, services, and products are designed with the protection of your information in mind.  We hope our Privacy Policy will help you make an informed decision about sharing your personal information with us.</p>
  <p class="mainP">Our Privacy Policy discloses ways in which we collect "personally identifiable information", how we safeguard your information, and how such information is used.</p>
  <p class="mainP">Personally identifiable information is any information that can be utilized to individually identify you, such as your name, phone number, or email address.  Such information is only gathered with your permission and voluntary submission.</p>
  <p class="mainP">Contrarily "Anonymous Information" is information that ordinarily cannot be traced back to a particular person.  Such data includes which results you delete or save, how you use our services and products, and how you navigate our products (such as the items you access and the search terms you query).   Anonymous information also includes the domain names and/or IP addresses of Internet browsers that visit our affiliated sites, the time of day the sites are visited, and other non-personal information.</p>
  <p class="mainP">Anonymous information can become personally identifiable information when it is associated with personally identifiable information such that it can be traced back to a particular individual.  Further details on how such information is gathered and used are disclosed below.</p>

  <p class="mainTopic">Third-Party Providers</p>
  <p class="mainP">Aurawin offers services and products to other parties who utilize or brand our solutions.  While we suggest that all of our clients maintain and fully disclose a privacy policy to their users, we cannot fully represent or guarantee that their privacy policies are in line with our own.   However, we try our best to develop solutions that cannot be abused by third parties.</p>
  <p class="mainP">Sites or applications labeled "Project of Aurawin" are fully maintained by Aurawin LLC and are subject to our Privacy Policy, while sites or applications indicating "Powered by Aurawin" are owned and operated by third parties and are subject to policies outside of our control.</p>
  <p class="mainP">Our affiliated sites, services and products may also display items or links that are developed by parties over whom Aurawin LLC exercises no control.  Linking to third party sites or results may subject your computer to cookies, data collection, or solicitation of personal information not associated with Aurawin. </p>

  <p class="mainTopic">Information Security</p>
  <p class="mainP">We acknowledge the great privilege and responsibility in serving your information and communication needs, and we strive to safeguard your network and information by securing our products and services.  We take a proactive approach to shielding information submitted directly to our applications and sites wholly controlled by Aurawin LLC and which is stored by Aurawin.</p>
  <p class="mainP">Our security measures protect against unauthorized access to, unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.  We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection.  We have additional security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control.  While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we use our best efforts to prevent such occurrences.</p>

  <p class="mainTopic">Information sharing</p>
  <p class="mainP">We do not sell or release personally identifying information to third parties, unless we have your consent.  On occasion, we may share such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on our behalf.  These instances are subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process such information only on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures. </p>
  <p class="mainP">We do not use or distribute solutions that provide "personal reporting" on specific users or allow other parties to gather specific information on particular users outside of what users openly and voluntarily provide to those parties.    We will not disclose activities of any one person unless she herself agrees to share such information with third parties.  To facilitate anonymity of users, Aurawin only grants third parties access to aggregated data, such as number of users who submitted a query or deleted a particular item.</p>
  <p class="mainP">In order to provide you the best quality service, we may share information submitted under your account among all of our services.  We will not disclose your account information to other parties, except under the circumstances described in this Policy or with your consent.</p>
  <p class="mainP">We may store and process personal information collected on our site in any place in which Aurawin LLC or its agents maintain facilities.  By using our services, you consent to the transfer of your information among these facilities, including those located outside your country.</p>
  <p class="mainP">If a governmental agency requests information in the form of a subpoena, court order, or other legal process, we will disclose only such information we have collected on our servers.  However, if we have a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights or safety of our users or the public, we will also provide such information.  </p>

  <p class="mainTopic">Protection for Minors</p>
  <p class="mainP">We believe protecting the safety of our children is our moral obligation, and we are dedicated in developing technologies to ensure online safety so families can feel secure.  We comply with the terms of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  We do not collect personally identifiable information from individual users under the age of 13.  Under COPPA, parents have the right and ability to control what personal information about their child may be disclosed to third parties. </p>
  <p class="mainP">While technological securities can be put in place, parents are vital in providing the best protection of their childâ€™s information by reporting non-compliance with COPPA, discussing Internet safety with their child in which information should not be disclosed, and monitoring time spent on the Internet and the purposes involved.</p>

  <p class="mainTopic">Anti-Spyware</p>
  <p class="mainP">We do not employ any technologies that automatically ascertain your identity.  We do not develop nor utilize technologies that track your activities outside of our products and services.  We find such technologies deplorable and not believe organizations should gather personal information on their users in this manner.  We believe that all information should be collected voluntarily and openly from users in order to establish a relationship of trust.</p>
